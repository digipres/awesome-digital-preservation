    <p class="jumbo-text">The digital preservation community is small and under resourced. This means we have to work together if we want to make a real impact. This site aims to provide a gateway to all of the wonderful community-owned and community-oriented resources out there that are dedicated to digital preservation.</p>

  The goal is to help the members of the international digital preservation community to find each other, to grow, and to find ways to support each other. Crucially, we want to help pool our knowledge and resources so we can do more and better preservation, and try to avoid anyone re-inventing the wheel. Of course, this ethos also extends to this gateway site, so please <a href="https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io/issues">raise any issues (e.g. what have we missed?)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io">contribute to this web site</a>, or <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/digipres">discuss your ideas with us</a>.
