### Learn About Digital Preservation

- The [Getting Started chapter of the Digital Preservation Handbook](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/getting-started) is a great place to start.
- [The Digital Preservation Handbook Glossary](https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/glossary) - Introduces a lot of the core terminology.
- For material that describes the broader issues, you can refer to [Digital Preservation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation), and consider contributing to the [Digital Preservation Wikipedia Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Digital_Preservation).
- Build your roadmap, guided by [the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation](http://ndsa.org/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/)
- Use the [Digital Preservation Business Case Toolkit](http://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=Digital_Preservation_Business_Case_Toolkit) to help get funding.
- Understanding your costs can help to plan your preservation work more effectively. The [Curation Costs Exchange](http://www.curationexchange.org/) allows you to compare your costing data with that of many other organisations.
- Learn about [Preserving digital Objects with Restricted Resources](http://digitalpowrr.niu.edu/)
- Learn how to [Authenticate, Manage, and Preserve Video](https://archiving.witness.org/) -- WITNESS trains activists to archive and preserve their video so that human rights abuses cannot be denied or forgotten over time.

- [Brainscape Digital Preservation Flash Cards](https://www.brainscape.com/p/1FA8-LH-5DKH7) - See <https://github.com/ross-spencer/brainscape-digital-preservation#readme> for more information.

### Find Formats

We need to understand the file formats of the resources we care for, and the software they depend on.

- [Search across format registries](https://digipres.org/formats/)
- Find or add formats to the [File Formats Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org)
- Understand [file format risks](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry) ([e.g. JP2](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2))
- [Game File Format Central](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Game_File_Format_Central) - Community project documenting over 1300 game related file-formats.
- [Just Solve It - File Formats Wiki](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Community project documenting a wide-variety of file formats.

If you have good examples of digital resources and their risks, please consider adding them to a test corpus.


### Experiment with Tools

<!--lint ignore double-link -->

There are a lot of tools out there (see [the tools section below](#find-more-tools)), but some tools are particularly great for early experimentation. These tools can be used right in your web browser, so you can get started without installing software locally.

#### Remote Services <!-- omit in toc -->

These tools are accessed using your browser, and work by sending a copy of your files to a remote server.

- [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried) - You can use the side bar to upload a file for Siegfried to identify the format.
- [Online TrID File Identifier](https://mark0.net/onlinetrid.html) - A web service that identifies files using [TrID](https://mark0.net/soft-trid-e.html).

#### In-Browser Tools <!-- omit in toc -->

These tools run entirely in your web browser, so no data is sent anywhere.

- [Siegfried JS](https://siegfried-js.glitch.me/) - This runs the Siegfried format identification tool on your files in your browser.
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) - The Cyber Swiss Army Knife. Capable of running lots of basic data operations on text or files, including computing things like MD5 or SHA hashes.
- [warc-analyser](https://edsu.github.io/warc-analyzer/) - Proof-of-concept that analyses WARC files in your browser. See <https://github.com/edsu/warc-analyzer> for more information.

### Engage Stakeholders

- Visual examples of digital preservation challenges, such as graphic corruption, can be incredibly useful in communicating the digital preservation message. That's why we built the Atlas of Digital Damages [Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/groups/2121762@N23/) and [website](http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info). Please add your own images of a digital preservation challenge, failed rendering, encoding damage, corrupt data, or visual evidence documenting to the Atlas of Digital Damages.
- Use the [POWRR One Pagers](http://powrr-wiki.lib.niu.edu/index.php/One_Pagers_tailored_to_educate_different_professionals) to educate stakeholders about the issues.
- Working with your IT department (some responses arising from [this question on twitter](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n/status/809343452995522560):
  - Backup versus preservation: ["I had useful discussions about 'for the long-term' and what issues that might throw up as a starting point."](https://twitter.com/CriticalSteph/status/809365764549595136)
  - ["often it comes down to language - avoid the word archiving. means 1 thing to IT & another DP professionals"](https://twitter.com/pnwagner/status/809356219471302656)
  - [Ten IT skills you need to have to work with digital preservation](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/ten-it-skills-you-need) - written by [Dave Thompson](https://twitter.com/d_n_t)

## Find Test Files

To improve our digital preservation tools, we need to be able to test them and evaluate of their performance. Publicly available sample files make this much easier. Tool developers can use them to test their work, discover bugs, and hone their tools ready for others to use. A test corpus can contain real digital objects from a collection, or be created specifically for exhibiting certain characteristics for testing purposes. Real data, particularly with examples of broken, badly formed or corrupted files can be particularly useful.

### Building Corpora

If the existing corpora aren't cutting it, perhaps you can contribute to the OPF Format Corpus hosted on GitHub. There's a [guide here on how to contribute](http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Collecting_format_ID_test_files) or you can [contact OPF](http://openpreservation.org/about/contact/) for help on how to get involved.

### Sourcing test files from web archives

Web archives can provide a useful source of files of particular formats. For example, [search via the UKWA interface](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/search?page=1&invert=&facet.fields=crawl_year&invert=&invert=&facet.fields=public_suffix&invert=&invert=&invert=&invert=&invert=&query=content_type%3A%22application%2Fmbox%22&totalCount=totalCount&order=asc).

## Find More Tools

Software tools give us the means the interrogate, manipulate, understand and ultimately preserve our digital data. The Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry, <a href="http://coptr.digipres.org/">COPTR</a> has unified five isolated tool registries. It provides an easy-to-edit wiki interface where we can share our knowledge about, and experiences with, tools used for digital preservation purposes.

- Find tools to solve your challenges with the [POWRR Tools Grid](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tools_Grid), generated from the COPTR wiki.
- Find tools [by function](http://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Function).
- Contribute your experiences of using tools to the [COPTR wiki](http://coptr.digipres.org/).
- If you find or create new tools, please [add them to COPTR](http://coptr.digipres.org/Guidelines_for_contributing_to_COPTR).


## Build Workflows

Resources to help build up preservation workflows, e.g. templates for how to use command-line tools, and how to chain things together.

- [ffmprovisr 'Making FFmpeg Easier'](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/) (example of how to use `ffmpeg` to perform specific tasks)
- [AMIA Open Source: List of open workflows for A/V resources](https://github.com/amiaopensource/open-workflows)

## Improve The Tools

Contributing to the development and improvement of tools is easy, even if you're not technical. Check out [this guide to making small documentation edits, or raising issues on GitHub](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/04/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/)

### Improving Identification

Identifying file formats is the bread and butter of digital preservation characterisation and assessment. Identification tool coverage and accuracy could be much better, and this primarily comes down to the signatures, or file format "magic", used to identify each format. You can help contribute and make our identification tools more effective here:

- [A basic guide for writing format signatures](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures) - Covers [Apache Tika](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA) and [DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/submitinfo.htm).
- [DROID/PRONOM also has this official guide](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/pronom-file-signature-research.pdf)
- [Contribute a file format signature to FILE](https://github.com/glensc/file) - See [this guide](http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-08-09-magic-editing-and-creation-primer).

### Improving Characterisation/Metadata Extraction

Deep file characterisation enables validation, identification of preservation risks and extraction of metadata. In developing a new characterisation capability, begin with thorough research to identify existing code to re-use or build on, develop a focused command line tool, then consider turning it into a JHOVE module.

- Develop a new file characterisation capability and turn it into a [JHOVE module](http://jhove.openpreservation.org/documentation/dev-module/), or an [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) module.
