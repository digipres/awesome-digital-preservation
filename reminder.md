This page just holds the template for a 'reminder' email, which we will send e.g. once or twice a year to the main digital preservation mailing lists, to remind people of the sites existence and purpose, and to encourage engagement (especially the Q&A site.)

Calling All Digital Preservers!

The digital preservation community is small and under resourced. This means we have to work together if we want to make a real impact. To this end, a small group of us has been attempting to help the members of the digital preservation community better support each other. The results of this include:

* The <http://www.digipres.org> site, which  aims to provide a gateway to all of the wonderful community-owned and community-oriented resources out there that are dedicated to digital preservation.
* The Digital Preservation Q&A site (<http://qanda.digipres.org/>), which is a Q&A site set up in the wake of the failure of the efforts to set up suitable Stack Exchange sites for our field.
* The COPTR Tool Registry (<http://coptr.digipres.org>), which was formed by the merger of many of the previous tool registry efforts, and which seeks to be a primary reference for those working in practical digital preservation.
* The POWRR Tool Grid v.2 (<http://www.digipres.org/tools/>), which is generated from COPTR registry.
* The Formats Overview (<http://www.digipres.org/formats/>), built by aggregating information from a number of different format registries.

If, like us, you believe we all need to work together, we'd love to hear from you....

* What have we missed from the front-page list? 
* Can you answer any of [the unanswered questions](http://qanda.digipres.org/unanswered)?
* Can you contribute to the COPTR wiki?
* Are these resources useful? Should we change our approach?

The last one is really important. We've been in digital preservation long enough to see a lot of portals and projects come and go, and we recognise that making it possible to build on past work sometimes requires changing the foundations.

Please get in touch if you have any questions. You could talk to us directly, or use the [digipres community forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/digipres) we set up for this purpose. We're happy to hear any and all ideas and criticisms!

Best wishes,

Andy Jackson ([@anjacks0n](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n)) and Paul Wheatley ([@prwheatley](https://twitter.com/prwheatley))
